	I didn’t make any changes outside of BTreeFile.java, as I didn’t find it necessary. In terms of design decisions, I avoided using helper methods for findLeafPage, as I found it easier to implement just using recursion of the findLeafPage method itself. The only other main design decision I made was using temp variables so that I didn’t have to move the parent entry and redo the pointers, instead I just had to edit the field key at the end of the functions. Wrapping my head around which child pointers to set for which entries for the steal left and right InternalPage functions was the hardest part of the lab for me. Once I was able to figure out exactly where the children should be going, implementing it was pretty easy.
